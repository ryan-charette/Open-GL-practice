## Color Cycle

This project demonstrates a simple OpenGL application that continuously cycles through colors using the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model. It converts HSV values to RGB and applies them as the background color of a window. The project uses GLFW for window management and GLAD for OpenGL function loading.

### Features
- Utilizes GLFW to create an OpenGL context and handle window operations.
- Uses GLAD for managing OpenGL function pointers.
- Implements a color cycle by continuously changing the hue value in the HSV color model.
- Converts HSV to RGB color values for rendering.

### Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed a C++ compiler like GCC, Clang, or MSVC.
- You have installed GLFW and GLAD libraries.
