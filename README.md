## Color Cycle

This project demonstrates a simple OpenGL application that continuously cycles through colors using the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model. It converts HSV values to RGB and applies them as the background color of a window. The project uses GLFW for window management and GLAD for OpenGL function loading.

### Features
- Utilizes GLFW to create an OpenGL context and handle window operations.
- Uses GLAD for managing OpenGL function pointers.
- Implements a color cycle by continuously changing the hue value in the HSV color model.
- Converts HSV to RGB color values for rendering.

### Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed a C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- You have installed GLFW and GLAD libraries.

## Polygonal Approximation of Circle

This project showcases a simple OpenGL application that visualizes the approximation of a circle using regular polygons. As the program runs, it gradually increases the number of sides on the polygon, transitioning from a triangle to a shape that closely approximates a circle. The project uses GLFW for window management and GLAD for OpenGL function loading.

### Features
- Utilizes GLFW to create an OpenGL context and handle window operations.
- Uses GLAD for managing OpenGL function pointers.
- Implements vertex shader and fragment shader for basic shape rendering.
- Dynamically increases the number of vertices to transition from an n-gon to a shape closely approximating a circle.

### Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed a C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- You have installed GLFW and GLAD libraries.
